# Fast.NET (v3)

### Framework introduction

A rapid build project that combines the strengths of hundreds of experts, focuses on Web Api applications, provides out-of-the-box functionality, and keeps up with the latest cutting-edge technologies of the .NET framework.

### Technology selection

- Fast.NET v3 version is developed in C# 10 and .NET 6.

#### Project Features:

- **Integrating the strengths of hundreds of schools**: Integrating hundreds of useful functions into one.
- **Out-of-the-box**: Provides many black technologies, no additional configuration or development work is required, and projects can be built quickly.
- **Stay up-to-date with cutting-edge technology**: Adopt the latest technologies and frameworks to always stay abreast of the latest trends and developments in the industry.

### Background of the project

In the past, .NET did not have a good open source environment and community in China. As more and more programmers use .NET in China, the domestic open source environment and community are gradually getting better and better.

Various .NET open source frameworks have also emerged in response to the times.

As a newbie who has been working in the .NET industry for N years, I have also used many open source frameworks, so I would like to make a small contribution to .NET open source based on my own work experience.

So Fast.NET (v3) was born.

**Continue to gather the strengths of hundreds of experts to improve and enrich the infrastructure of this framework, adding a choice to the .NET ecosystem! **

### Statement

```
This framework can be said to continue to reinvent the wheel based on the predecessors, but it is simpler and more convenient than some frameworks on the market. It's better to use. I don't know if we can talk about it.

There is another point about the recent commercialization of "Furion" that has attracted the attention of many people, including me. I do not make any suggestions or opinions here.
All I can say is that if you find it useful and can be used, then you can continue to use it. If you find it difficult to use, you can use another frame, or choose to make your own wheels.
```
