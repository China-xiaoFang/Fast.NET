# Fast.NET（v3）

An application utility class (framework) that you can integrate into any `.NET` application.

## Technology selection

- `Fast.NET` v3 version is developed using `C#10` and `.NET6` `.NET7` `.NET8`.

## Background of the project

In the past, `.NET` did not have a good open source environment and community in China. As more and more programmers use `.NET` in China, the domestic open source environment and community are gradually getting better and better.

Various `.NET` open source frameworks have also emerged in response to the times.

As a newbie who has been working in the `.NET` industry for N years, I have also used many open source frameworks, so I want to make a small contribution to `.NET` open source based on my own work experience and experience. Small contribution.

## Install

Select the tool module library you need to install. For example:

```
dotnet add package Fast.xxx
```

## example

Introduce and use as needed~~~

```cs
using Fast.Cache;
using Fast.DependencyInjection;
using Fast.DynamicApplication;
using Fast.EventBus;
using Fast.JwtBearer;
using Fast.Logging;
using Fast.Mapster;
using Fast.NET.Core;
using Fast.Serialization;
using Fast.SqlSugar;
using Fast.Swagger;
using Fast.UnifyResult;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Initialize the frame
builder.Initialize();

// Add log service
builder.Services.AddLoggingService(builder.Environment);

// Add Gzip compression
builder.Services.AddGzipCompression();

// Add cross-domain service
builder.Services.AddCorsAccessor();

// Add Mapster service
builder.Services.AddMapster();

// Add serialization service
builder.Services.AddSerialization();

// Add dependency injection service
builder.Services.AddDependencyInjection();

// Add event bus service
builder.Services.AddEventBus();

// Add Redis cache service
builder.Services.AddCache();

// Add JwtBearer service
builder.Services.AddJwtBearer(builder.Configuration);

// Add SqlSugar service
builder.Services.AddSqlSugar(builder.Configuration);

// Add controller.
builder.Services.AddControllers();

// Add dynamic API service
builder.Services.AddDynamicApplication();

// Add normalized return service
builder.Services.AddUnifyResult(builder.Configuration);

// Add standardized document service
builder.Services.AddSwaggerDocuments(builder.Configuration);

var app = builder.Build();

// Mandatory HTTPS.
app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.UseStaticFiles();

// Enable backward reading.
app.EnableBuffering();

app.UseRouting();

app.MapControllers();

// Enable normalized documents
app.UseSwaggerDocuments();

app.Run();
```

## Disclaimer

     Please do not use it for projects that violate the laws of our country.

     This framework can be said to continue to reinvent the wheel based on the predecessors, but it is simpler and more convenient than some frameworks on the market. It's better to use. I don't know if we can talk about it.
